# Pixeldrain Enhancer

This UserScript, enhances the functionality of [Pixeldrain.com](https://pixeldrain.com) by providing additional features related to video playback.

Since `10 May 2024` the script supports [Patreon.com](https://www.patreon.com) too.

## Features

- **Save Video Time**: Automatically saves the current time of a video on Pixeldrain.com to allow users to resume playback from where they left off.
- **Persistent Volume**: Allows users to set a persistent volume level for videos, ensuring consistent audio levels across different sessions.
- **Real-Time Saves**: Provides the option to enable real-time updates for saving video time, ensuring more accurate playback tracking.

## Usage

1. Install a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey.
2. Copy the script provided into a new script in Tampermonkey.
3. Save the script and navigate to Pixeldrain.com or Patreon.com.
4. The script will launch when you open the website. All of the toggleable features are disabled by default. (Except 'Video Time Tracking')

## User Interface (UI)

- The script adds a draggable UI container to the top-right corner of the page.
- Users can enable/disable features/settings using the provided buttons in the UI.

## Work in Progress (WIP)

- Some features are missing from the UI, but they will be added in the future.

## Possible Future Features

- Pinnable ui (when pinned it remembers the spot on the screen where it was pinned and when reopened it opens in the pinned location)
